mkfs.btrfs - create a btrfs filesystem

==SYNOPSIS==

'''mkfs.btrfs''' [-A|--alloc-start &lt;alloc-start&gt;] [-b|--byte-count &lt;byte-count&gt;] [-d|--data &lt;data-profile&gt;] [-m|--metadata &lt;metadata profile&gt;] [-M|--mixed] [-l|--leafsize &lt;leafsize&gt;] [-n|--nodesize &lt;nodesize&gt;] [-s|--sectorsize &lt;sectorsize&gt;] [-L|--label &lt;label&gt;] [-K|--nodiscard] [-r|--rootdir &lt;rootdir&gt;] [-O|--features &lt;feature1&gt;[,&lt;feature2&gt;...]] [-U|--uuid &lt;UUID&gt;] [-f|--force] [-q|--quiet] [--help] [-V|--version] &lt;device&gt; [&lt;device&gt;...]

==DESCRIPTION==

'''mkfs.btrfs''' is used to create the btrfs filesystem on a single or multiple devices. &lt;device&gt; is typically a block device but can be a file-backed image as well. Multiple devices are grouped by UUID of the filesystem.

Before mounting such filesystem, the kernel module must know all the devices either via preceding execution of '''btrfs device scan''' or using the '''device''' mount option. See section '''MULTIPLE DEVICES''' for more details.

==OPTIONS==

; '''-A|--alloc-start &lt;offset&gt;'''
: (An option to help debugging chunk allocator.) Specify the (physical) offset from the start of the device at which allocations start. The default value is zero.
; '''-b|--byte-count &lt;size&gt;'''
: Specify the size of the filesystem. If this option is not used, mkfs.btrfs uses the entire device space for the filesystem.
; '''-d|--data &lt;profile&gt;'''
: Specify the profile for the data block groups. Valid values are '''raid0''', '''raid1''', '''raid5''', '''raid6''', '''raid10''' or '''single''' or dup (case does not matter). <br />See '''DUP PROFILES ON A SINGLE DEVICE''' for more.
; '''-m|--metadata &lt;profile&gt;'''
: Specify the profile for the metadata block groups. Valid values are '''raid0''', '''raid1''', '''raid5''', '''raid6''', '''raid10''', '''single''' or '''dup''', (case does not matter). <br />A single device filesystem will default to '''DUP''', unless a SSD is detected. Then it will default to '''single'''. The detection is based on the value of <code>/sys/block/DEV/queue/rotational</code>, where '''DEV''' is the short name of the device. <br />Note that the rotational status can be arbitrarily set by the underlying block device driver and may not reflect the true status (network block device, memory-backed SCSI devices etc). Use the options '''--data/--metadata''' to avoid confusion. <br />See '''DUP PROFILES ON A SINGLE DEVICE''' for more details.
; '''-M|--mixed'''
: Normally the data and metadata block groups are isolated. The '''mixed''' mode will remove the isolation and store both types in the same block group type. This helps to utilize the free space regardless of the purpose and is suitable for small devices. The separate allocation of block groups leads to a situation where the space is reserved for the other block group type, is not available for allocation and can lead to ENOSPC state. <br />The recommended size for the mixed mode is for filesystems less than 1GiB. The soft recommendation is to use it for filesystems smaller than 5GiB. Thie mixed mode may lead to degraded performance on larger filesystems, but is otherwise usable, even on multiple devices. <br />The '''nodesize''' and '''sectorsize''' must be equal, and the block group types must match. <br />'''Note:''' versions up to 4.2.x forced the mixed mode for devices smaller than 1GiB. This has been removed in 4.3+ as it caused some usability issues.
; '''-l|--leafsize &lt;size&gt;'''
: Alias for --nodesize. Deprecated.
; '''-n|--nodesize &lt;size&gt;'''
: Specify the nodesize, the tree block size in which btrfs stores metadata. The default value is 16KiB (16384) or the page size, whichever is bigger. Must be a multiple of the sectorsize, but not larger than 64KiB (65536). Leafsize always equals nodesize and the options are aliases. <br />Smaller node size increases fragmentation but lead to higher b-trees which in turn leads to lower locking contention. Higher node sizes give better packing and less fragmentation at the cost of more expensive memory operations while updating the metadata blocks. <br />'''Note:''' versions up to 3.11 set the nodesize to 4k.
; '''-s|--sectorsize &lt;size&gt;'''
: Specify the sectorsize, the minimum data block allocation unit. <br />The default value is the page size and is autodetected. If the sectorsize differs from the page size, the created filesystem may not be mountable by the kernel. Therefore it is not recommended to use this option unless you are going to mount it on a system with the appropriate page size.
; '''-L|--label &lt;string&gt;'''
: Specify a label for the filesystem. The '''string''' should be less than 256 bytes and must not contain newline characters.
; '''-K|--nodiscard'''
: Do not perform whole device TRIM operation on devices that are capable of that.
; '''-r|--rootdir &lt;rootdir&gt;'''
: Populate the toplevel subvolume with files from '''rootdir'''. This does not require root permissions and does not mount the filesystem.
; '''-O|--features &lt;feature1&gt;[,&lt;feature2&gt;…]'''
: A list of filesystem features turned on at mkfs time. Not all features are supported by old kernels. To disable a feature, prefix it with '''^'''. <br />See section '''FILESYSTEM FEATURES''' for more details. To see all available features that mkfs.btrfs supports run: <br /><code>mkfs.btrfs -O list-all</code>
; '''-f|--force'''
: Forcibly overwrite the block devices when an existing filesystem is detected. By default, mkfs.btrfs will utilize '''libblkid''' to check for any known filesystem on the devices. Alternatively you can use the <code>wipefs</code> utility to clear the devices.
; '''-q|--quiet'''
: Print only error or warning messages. Options --features or --help are unaffected.
; '''-U|--uuid &lt;UUID&gt;'''
: Create the filesystem with the given '''UUID'''. The UUID must not exist on any filesystem currently present.
; '''-V|--version'''
: Print the '''mkfs.btrfs''' version and exit.
; '''--help'''
: Print help.

==SIZE UNITS==

The default unit is '''byte'''. All size parameters accept suffixes in the 1024 base. The recognized suffixes are: '''k''', '''m''', '''g''', '''t''', '''e''', both uppercase and lowercase.

==MULTIPLE DEVICES==

Before mounting a multiple device filesystem, the kernel module must know the association of the block devices that are attached to the filesystem UUID.

There is typically no action needed from the user. On a system that utilizes a udev-like daemon, any new block device is automatically registered. The rules call '''btrfs device scan'''.

The same command can be used to trigger the device scanning if the btrfs kernel module is reloaded (naturally all previous information about the device registration is lost).

Another possibility is to use the mount options '''device''' to specify the list of devices to scan at the time of mount.

 <code><nowiki># mount -o device=/dev/sdb,device=/dev/sdc /dev/sda /mnt</nowiki></code>

'''Note:''' that this means only scanning, if the devices do not exist in the system, mount will fail anyway. This can happen on systems without initramfs/initrd and root partition created with RAID1/10/5/6 profiles. The mount action can happen before all block devices are discovered. The waiting is usually done on the initramfs/initrd systems.

==FILESYSTEM FEATURES==

; '''mixed-bg'''
: mixed data and metadata block groups, also set by option '''--mixed'''
; '''extref'''
: (default since btrfs-progs 3.12, kernel support since 3.7) <br />increased hardlink limit per file in a directory to 65536, older kernels supported a varying number of hardlinks depending on the sum of all file name sizes that can be stored into one metadata block
; '''raid56'''
: extended format for RAID5/6, also enabled if raid5 or raid6 block groups are selected
; '''skinny-metadata'''
: (default since btrfs-progs 3.18, kernel support since 3.10) <br />reduced-size metadata for extent references, saves a few percent of metadata
; '''no-holes'''
: improved representation of file extents where holes are not explicitly stored as an extent, saves a few percent of metadata if sparse files are used

==BLOCK GROUPS, CHUNKS, RAID==

The highlevel organizational units of a filesystem are block groups of three types: data, metadata and system.

; '''DATA'''
: store data blocks and nothing else
; '''METADATA'''
: store internal metadata in b-trees, can store file data if they fit into the inline limit
; '''SYSTEM'''
: store structures that describe the mapping between the physical devices and the linear logical space representing the filesystem

Other terms commonly used:

; '''block group'''
; '''chunk'''
: a logical range of space of a given profile, stores data, metadata or both; sometimes the terms are used interchangably <br />A typical size of metadata block group is 256MiB (filesystem smaller than 50GiB) and 1GiB (larger than 50GiB), for data it’s 1GiB. The system block group size is a few megabytes.
; '''RAID'''
: a block group profile type that utilizes RAID-like features on multiple devices: striping, mirroring, parity
; '''profile'''
: when used in connection with block groups refers to the allocation strategy and constraints, see the section '''PROFILES''' for more details

==PROFILES==

There are the following block group types available:

'''Note:''' DUP may exist on more than 1 device if it starts on a single device and another one is added, but '''mkfs.btrfs''' will not let you create DUP on multiple devices.

==DUP PROFILES ON A SINGLE DEVICE==

The mkfs utility will let the user create a filesystem with profiles that write the logical blocks to 2 physical locations. Whether there are really 2 physical copies highly depends on the underlying device type.

For example, a SSD drive can remap the blocks internally to a single copy thus deduplicating them. This negates the purpose of increased redunancy and just wastes space.

The duplicated data/metadata may still be useful to statistically improve the chances on a device that might perform some internal optimizations. The actual details are not usually disclosed by vendors. As another example, the widely used USB flash or SD cards use a translation layer. The data lifetime may be affected by frequent plugging. The memory cells could get damaged, hopefully not destroying both copies of particular data.

The traditional rotational hard drives usually fail at the sector level.

In any case, a device that starts to misbehave and repairs from the DUP copy should be replaced! '''DUP is not backup'''.

==KNOWN ISSUES==

'''SMALL FILESYSTEMS AND LARGE NODESIZE'''

The combination of small filesystem size and large nodesize is not recommended in general and can lead to various ENOSPC-related issues during mount time or runtime.

Since mixed block group creation is optional, we allow small filesystem instances with differing values for '''sectorsize''' and '''nodesize''' to be created and could end up in the following situation:

 <code><nowiki># mkfs.btrfs -f -n 65536 /dev/loop0
 btrfs-progs v3.19-rc2-405-g976307c
 See http://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org for more information.</nowiki></code>

 <code><nowiki># mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/
 mount: mount /dev/loop0 on /mnt failed: No space left on device</nowiki></code>

The ENOSPC occurs during the creation of the UUID tree. This is caused by large metadata blocks and space reservation strategy that allocates more than can fit into the filesystem.
