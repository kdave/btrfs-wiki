TBD: list hardware classes, list specific types of known buggy firmware/drive type combinations, possible workarounds, recommendations, warnings

Collective knowledge of buggy hardware, community based.

Confidence:

* ''low'' -- not enough reports, the cause could be something else
* ''moderate'' -- likely that's a hardware problem, better avoid if not sure
* ''high'' -- enough reports have been analyzed to pinpoint the cause to a particular hardware type/version

The section 5 of manual page contains general overview of the [https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs/blob/master/Documentation/btrfs-man5.asciidoc#storage-model storage model] and classes of [https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs/blob/master/Documentation/btrfs-man5.asciidoc#hardware-considerations hardware-induced bugs].

'''New entries''' -- please open an issue at https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs/ or send a mail request to linux-btrfs@vger.kernel.org or add the entry manually.
