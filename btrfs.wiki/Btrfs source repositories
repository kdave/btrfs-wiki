Since 2.6.29-rc1, Btrfs has been included in the mainline kernel.

Warning, Btrfs evolves very quickly do not test it unless:

# You have good backups and you have tested the restore capability
# You have a backup installation that you can switch to when something breaks
# You are willing to report any issues you find
# You can apply patches and compile the latest btrfs code against your kernel (quite easy with git and dkms, see below)
# You acknowledge that btrfs may eat your data
# Backups! Backups! Backups!

Everyone tests with the latest btrfs code from git. Even the latest Linus kernel probably doesn't have the latest, so if you're really interested in using and testing btrfs, get btrfs from git. Distributions usually offer a way to install a kernel built from git.

== Official repositories ==

The sources of the userspace utilities can be obtained from these repositories:

* git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kdave/btrfs-progs.git ([http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/kdave/btrfs-progs.git;a=summary gitweb access])
* git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mason/btrfs-progs.git ([http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mason/btrfs-progs.git;a=summary gitweb access]) (apparently no longer synced)

There are 2 repositories that get synced at the time of a release ([http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/38063 announcement]) and can be considered equal for non-development branches.

The '''master''' branch of the repositories is updated at the time of a release and is not used for development. This branch is never rebased.

Devleopment git repositories:

* git://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs.git ([https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs web access])
* git://repo.or.cz/btrfs-progs-unstable/devel.git ([http://repo.or.cz/w/btrfs-progs-unstable/devel.git web access])

== Development branches ==

The latest '''development branch''' is called '''devel'''. Contains patches that are reviewed or tested and on the way to the next release. When a patch is added to the branch, a mail notification is sent as a reply to the patch.

The git repositories on ''kernel.org'' are not used for development or integration branches.

== Integration branches ==

'''Integration branches''' collect patches that may need public testing and are provided for convenience to developers or users willing to test unstable version. The patches in these branches are not guaranteed to be merged. The branches are assembled from scratch and serve more like a snapshots than stable bases for other development.

 git://repo.or.cz/btrfs-progs-unstable/devel.git integration-''YYYYMMDD''

where ''YYYYMMDD'' is the date of the branch.

To check out this repository, and select the latest branch, use:

 git clone git://repo.or.cz/btrfs-progs-unstable/devel.git
 cd devel
 git checkout integration-''YYYYMMDD''

Mirror of the repository is at
 git://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs.git

and has the same layout as the previous repository. 

Note that this branch can be rebased when there's good reason for that (adding Reported-by/Reviewed-by tags to the middle of the patch series) or if there's a change needed down the patch stack in general. The point is to keep the git history clean.

== Note to GitHub users ==

The pull requests will not be accepted directly, the preferred way is to send patches to the mailinglist instead. You can link to a branch in any git repository if the mails do not make it to the mailinglist or for convenience.

The development model of btrfs-progs shares a lot with the kernel model. The github way is different in some ways. We, the upstream community, expect that the patches meet some criteria (often lacking in github contributions):

* proper '''subject line''': eg. prefix with ''btrfs-progs: subpart, ...'' , descriptive yet not too long
* proper '''changelog''': the changelogs are often missing or lacking explanation ''why'' the change was made, or ''how'' is something broken, ''what'' are user-visible effects of the bug or the fix, ''how'' does an improvement help or the intended ''usecase''
* the '''Signed-off-by''' line: this document who authored the change, you can read more about the ''The Developer's Certificate of Origin'' [https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches here (chapter 11)]
* '''one logical change''' per patch: eg. not mixing bugfixes, cleanups, features etc., sometimes it's not clear and will be usually pointed out during reviews

= Administration and support tools =

There is a separate repository of useful scripts for common administrative tasks on btrfs. This is at:

https://github.com/kdave/btrfsmaintenance/

= btrfs kernel module git repository =

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mason/linux-btrfs.git ([http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mason/linux-btrfs.git;a=summary Gitweb access])

= Patches sent to mailinglist =

A convenient interface to get an overview of patches and the related mail discussions can be found at https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-btrfs/list/ .

It is possible to directly apply a patch by pasting the ''mbox'' link from the patch page to the command

 $ wget -O - '<nowiki>https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/123456/mbox</nowiki>' | git am -

you may want to add ''--reject'', or decide otherwise what to do with the patch.

= Build =
== Dependencies ==

Before compiling the userspace tools you'll need to get some dependencies:

=== Fedora ===

 yum install libuuid-devel libattr-devel zlib-devel libacl-devel e2fsprogs-devel libblkid-devel lzo2-devel asciidoc xmlto

Note that some Fedora/Red Hat derived distributions use lzo-devel instead of lzo2-devel.

=== Debian/Ubuntu ===

 sudo apt-get install asciidoc xmlto --no-install-recommends

Followed by either of:
 sudo apt-get build-dep btrfs-tools 
 -or-
 sudo apt-get install uuid-dev libattr1-dev zlib1g-dev libacl1-dev e2fslibs-dev libblkid-dev liblzo2-dev autoconf make

If you tried the first and get "cannot find llzo2", or "blkid/blkid.h: No such file or directory" try the second; your distro has an even older version of btrfs-progs packaged than expected.

=== Arch Linux ===

 pacman -S e2fsprogs

=== openSUSE ===

 zypper in libattr-devel zlib-devel libacl-devel libext2fs-devel libuuid-devel libblkid-devel lzo-devel asciidoc xmlto

== Build ==

Once you have everything in place, you can run 

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure
 make

to build the user-space tools. After that they can be used like this:

 ./btrfs fi show
