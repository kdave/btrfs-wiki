==NAME==
btrfstune - tune various filesystem parameters

==SYNOPSIS==

<p><b>btrfstune</b> [options] <em>&lt;device&gt;</em> [<em>&lt;device&gt;</em>&#8230;]</p>
==DESCRIPTION==

<p><b>btrfstune</b> can be used to enable, disable, or set various filesystem
parameters. The filesystem must be unmounted.</p>
<p>The common usecase is to enable features that were not enabled at mkfs time.
Please make sure that you have kernel support for the features.  You can find a
complete list of features and kernel version of their introduction at
https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Changelog#By_feature .  Also, the
manual page [[Manpage/mkfs.btrfs|mkfs.btrfs(8)]] contains more details about the features.</p>
<p>Some of the features could be also enabled on a mounted filesystem by other
means.  Please refer to the <em>FILESYSTEM FEATURES</em> in [[Manpage/btrfs|btrfs(5)]].</p>
==OPTIONS==

<dl>
<dt>
-f
<dd>
<p>
Allow dangerous changes, e.g. clear the seeding flag or change fsid. Make sure
that you are aware of the dangers.
</p>

<dt>
-m
<dd>
<p>
(since kernel: 5.0)
</p>
<p>change fsid stored as <em>metadata_uuid</em> to a randomly generated UUID,
see also <em>-U</em></p>

<dt>
-M <em>&lt;UUID&gt;</em>
<dd>
<p>
(since kernel: 5.0)
</p>
<p>change fsid stored as <em>metadata_uuid</em> to a given UUID, see also <em>-U</em></p>
<p>The metadata_uuid is stored only in the superblock and is a backward
incompatible change. The fsid in metadata blocks remains unchanged and
is not overwritten, thus the whole operation is significantly faster than
<em>-U</em>.</p>
<p>The new metadata_uuid can be used for mount by UUID and is also used to
identify devices of a multi-device filesystem.</p>

<dt>
-n
<dd>
<p>
(since kernel: 3.14)
</p>
<p>Enable no-holes feature (more efficient representation of file holes), enabled
by mkfs feature <em>no-holes</em>.</p>

<dt>
-r
<dd>
<p>
(since kernel: 3.7)
</p>
<p>Enable extended inode refs (hardlink limit per file in a directory is 65536),
enabled by mkfs feature <em>extref</em>.</p>

<dt>
-S <em>&lt;0|1&gt;</em>
<dd>
<p>
Enable seeding on a given device. Value 1 will enable seeding, 0 will disable it.<br/>
A seeding filesystem is forced to be mounted read-only. A new device can be added
to the filesystem and will capture all writes keeping the seeding device intact.
See also section <em>SEEDING DEVICE</em> in [[Manpage/btrfs|btrfs(5)]].
</p>
<blockquote><b>Warning:</b>
Clearing the seeding flag on a device may be dangerous.
If a previously-seeding device is changed, all filesystems that used that
device will become unmountable. Setting the seeding flag back will not fix
that.<br/>
A valid usecase is <em>seeding device as a base image</em>. Clear the seeding
flag, update the filesystem and make it seeding again, provided that it&#8217;s OK
to throw away all filesystems built on top of the previous base.</blockquote>

<dt>
-u
<dd>
<p>
Change fsid to a randomly generated UUID or continue previous fsid change
operation in case it was interrupted.
</p>

<dt>
-U <em>&lt;UUID&gt;</em>
<dd>
<p>
Change fsid to <em>UUID</em> in all metadata blocks.
</p>
<p>The <em>UUID</em> should be a 36 bytes string in [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html printf(3)] format
<em>"%08x-%04x-%04x-%04x-%012x"</em>.
If there is a previous unfinished fsid change, it will continue only if the
<em>UUID</em> matches the unfinished one or if you use the option <em>-u</em>.</p>
<p>All metadata blocks are rewritten, this may take some time, but the final
filesystem compatibility is unaffected, unlike <em>-M</em>.</p>
<blockquote><b>Warning:</b>
Cancelling or interrupting a UUID change operation will make the
filesystem temporarily unmountable.  To fix it, rerun <em>btrfstune -u</em> and let
it complete.</blockquote>

<dt>
-x
<dd>
<p>
(since kernel: 3.10)
</p>
<p>Enable skinny metadata extent refs (more efficient representation of extents),
enabled by mkfs feature <em>skinny-metadata</em>.</p>
<p>All newly created extents will use the new representation. To completely switch
the entire filesystem, run a full balance of the metadata. Please refer to
[[Manpage/btrfs-balance|btrfs-balance(8)]].</p>

</dl>
==EXIT STATUS==

<p><b>btrfstune</b> returns 0 if no error happened, 1 otherwise.</p>
==COMPATIBILITY NOTE==

<p>This deprecated tool exists for historical reasons but is still in use today.
Its functionality will be merged to the main tool, at which time <b>btrfstune</b>
will be declared obsolete and scheduled for removal.</p>
