= Overview =

For a list of features by their introduction, please see the table [[Changelog#By_feature]].

The table below aims to serve as an overview for the stability status of the features BTRFS supports.
While a feature may be functionally safe and reliable, it does not necessarily
mean that its useful, for example in meeting your performance expectations for
your specific workload. Combination of features can vary in performance, the
table does not cover all possibilities.

'''The table is based on the latest released linux kernel: 5.18'''

The columns for each feature reflrect the status of the implementation in following ways:

''Stability'' - completeness of the implementation, usecase coverage<br>
''Status since'' - kernel version when the status has been last changed<br>
''Performance'' - how much it could be improved until the inherent limits are hit<br>
''Notes'' - short description of the known issues, or other information related to status

''Legend:''
* '''OK''': should be safe to use, no known major defficiencies
* '''mostly OK''': safe for general use, there are some known problems that do not affect majority of users
* '''Unstable''': do not use for other then testing purposes, known severe problems, missing implementation of some core parts

This page reflects status of the whole project and edits need to be approved by one of the maintainers ([[User_talk:kdave|kdave]]).
Suggest edits if:

* there's a known missing entry
* a particular feature combination that has a different status and is worth mentioning separately
* you knouw of a bug that lowers the feature status
* a reference could be enhanced by an actual link to documentation (wiki, manual pages)

== Details that do not fit the table ==

=== Defrag ===

The data affected by the defragmentation process will be newly written and will consume new space, the links to the original extents will not be kept. See also [[Manpage/btrfs-filesystem]]. Though autodefrag affects newly written data, it can read a few adjacent blocks (up to 64k) and write the contiguous extent to a new location. The adjacent blocks will be unshared. This happens on a smaller scale than the on-demand defrag and doesn't have the same impact.

=== RAID1, RAID10 ===

The simple redundancy RAID levels utilize different mirrors in a way that does
not achieve the maximum performance. The logic can be improved so the reads
will spread over the mirrors evenly or based on device congestion.

=== RAID56 ===

Please see https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/btrfs-man5.html#raid56-status-and-recommended-practices .

=== Device replace ===

Device ''replace'' and device ''delete'' insist on being able to read or reconstruct all data.  If any read fails due to an IO error, the delete/replace operation is aborted and the administrator must remove or replace the damaged data before trying again.

= On-disk format =

The filesystem disk format is stable. This means it is not expected to change
unless there are very strong reasons to do so. If there is a format change,
filesystems which implement the previous disk format will continue to be
mountable and usable by newer kernels.

The core of the on-disk format that comprises building blocks of the
filesystem:

* layout of the main data structures, eg. superblock, b-tree nodes, b-tree keys, block headers
* the COW mechanism, based on the original design of Ohad Rodeh's paper "Shadowing and clones"

Newly introduced features build on top of the above and could add specific
structures. If a backward compatibility is not possible to maintain, a bit in
the filesystem superblock denotes that and the level of incompatibility (full,
read-only mount possible).
