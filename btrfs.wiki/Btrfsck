{{Deprecated|The tool btrfsck functionality has been merged to 'btrfs check' command. See [[Manpage/btrfs-check]].}}
{{Outdated|}}

Check consistency of a btrfs filesystem, and optionally repair some types of breakage. Can only be run on an unmounted FS.

Note that while this tool should be able to repair broken filesystems, it is still relatively new code, and has not seen widespread testing on a large range of real-life breakage. It is possible that it may cause additional damage in the process of repair.

If you have a broken filesystem, you should probably look at the recovery or [[FAQ#When_will_Btrfs_have_a_fsck_like_tool.3F|repair]] tools or you can read [http://marc.merlins.org/perso/btrfs/post_2014-03-19_Btrfs-Tips_-Btrfs-Scrub-and-Btrfs-Filesystem-Repair.html Marc MERLIN's page that explains the different ways to check and fix a btrfs filesystem].

In a nutshell, you should look at:
* btrfs scrub to detect issues on live filesystems
* look at btrfs detected errors in syslog (look at Marc's blog above on how to use sec.pl to do this)
* mount -o ro,recovery to mount a filesystem with issues
* btrfs-zero-log might help in specific cases. Go read [[Btrfs-zero-log]]
* btrfs restore will help you copy data off a broken btrfs filesystem. See its page: [[Restore]]
* btrfs check --repair, aka btrfsck is your last option if the ones above have not worked.

== Usage ==

 btrfsck &lt;device&gt;

If all goes well, it should look something like this:
 gargamel:/mnt/btrfs_pool1# btrfsck /dev/mapper/raid0d1

Note however that instead it could run for 24H or more on a filesystem of a few terabytes, and look like it's never going to complete. In my experience it's also not unusual to get tens to over a hundred thousand lines of output showing lines like:
 Extent back ref already exists for 2148837945344 parent 0 root 257
 leaf parent key incorrect 504993210368
 bad block 504993210368

FIXME: are those real problems or unfortunate real problems that easily happen btrfs filesystems?

FIXME2: I'm also pretty sure these issues didn't show up in a scrub
