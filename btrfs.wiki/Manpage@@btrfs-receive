==NAME==
btrfs-receive - receive subvolumes from send stream

==SYNOPSIS==

<p><b>btrfs receive</b> [options] <em>&lt;path&gt;</em></p>
==DESCRIPTION==

<p>Receive a stream of changes and replicate one or more subvolumes that were
previously used with <b>btrfs send</b> The received subvolumes are stored to
<em>path</em>.</p>
<p><b>btrfs receive</b> will fail int the following cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
receiving subvolume already exists
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
previously received subvolume was changed after it was received
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
default subvolume has changed or you didn&#8217;t mount BTRFS filesystem at the toplevel subvolume
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A subvolume is made read-only after the receiving process finishes succesfully.</p>
<p><tt>Options</tt></p>
<dl>
<dt>
-v
<dd>
<p>
enable verbose debug output, print each operation (each occurrence of this
option increases the verbosity level)
</p>

<dt>
-f <em>&lt;infile&gt;</em>
<dd>
<p>
by default, btrfs receive uses standard input to receive the stream,
use this option to read from a file instead
</p>

<dt>
-C|--chroot
<dd>
<p>
confine the process to <em>path</em> using [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chroot.1.html chroot(1)]
</p>

<dt>
-e
<dd>
<p>
terminate after receiving an <em>end cmd</em> marker in the stream.
</p>
<p>Without this option, the receiver terminates only if an error is encountered
or at end of file</p>

<dt>
--max-errors <em>&lt;N&gt;</em>
<dd>
<p>
terminate as soon as N errors happened while processing commands from the send
stream, default value is 1, 0 means no limit
</p>

<dt>
-m <em>&lt;mountpoint&gt;</em>
<dd>
<p>
the root mount point of the destination filesystem
</p>
<p>By default the mountpoint is searched in <em>/proc/self/mounts</em>.
If you do not have <em>/proc</em>, eg. in a chroot environment, use this option to tell
us where this filesystem is mounted.</p>
