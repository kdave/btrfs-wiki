== What information to provide when asking a support question ==

When reporting errors or asking for support always supply the output of the following commands:

   uname -a
   btrfs --version
   btrfs fi show
   btrfs fi df /home # Replace /home with the mount point of your btrfs-filesystem 
   dmesg > dmesg.log

A lot of debug information can be retrieved from dmesg. If the relevant log information is very large, supply the output as an attachment in the mail instead of in the message body (though mind the [[#Restrictions|restrictions]] above).
