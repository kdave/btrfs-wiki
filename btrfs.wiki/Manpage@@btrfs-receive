==NAME==

btrfs-receive - receive subvolumes from stdin/file.

==SYNOPSIS==

'''btrfs receive''' [-ve] [-f &lt;infile&gt;] &lt;mount&gt;

==DESCRIPTION==

Receives one or more subvolumes that were previously sent with '''btrfs send'''. The received subvolumes are stored into &lt;mount&gt;.

'''btrfs receive''' will fail with the following case:

# a receiving subvolume already exists.
# a previously received subvolume was changed after it was received.
# default subvolume is changed or you donâ€™t mount btrfs filesystem with fs tree.

After receiving a subvolume, it is immediately set to read only.

<code>Options</code>

; -v
: Enable verbose debug output. Each occurrence of this option increases the verbose level more.
; -f &lt;infile&gt;
: By default, btrfs receive uses stdin to receive the subvolumes. Use this option to specify a file to use instead.
; -e
: Terminate after receiving an &lt;end cmd&gt; in the data stream. Without this option, the receiver terminates only if an error is recognized or on EOF.
; --max-errors &lt;N&gt;
: Terminate as soon as N errors happened while processing commands from the send stream. Default value is 1. A value of 0 means no limit.

==EXIT STATUS==

'''btrfs receive''' returns a zero exist status if it succeeds. Non zero is returned in case of failure.

==AVAILABILITY==

'''btrfs''' is part of btrfs-progs. Please refer to the btrfs wiki http://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org for further details.
