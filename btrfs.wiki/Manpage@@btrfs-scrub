==NAME==
btrfs-scrub - scrub btrfs filesystem, verify block checksums

==SYNOPSIS==

<p><b>btrfs scrub</b> <em>&lt;subcommand&gt;</em> <em>&lt;args&gt;</em></p>
==DESCRIPTION==

<p><b>btrfs scrub</b> is used to scrub a btrfs filesystem, which will read all data
and metadata blocks from all devices and verify checksums. Automatically repair
corrupted blocks if there&#8217;s a correct copy available.</p>
<blockquote><b>Note:</b>
Scrub is not a filesystem checker (fsck) and does not verify nor repair
structural damage in the filesystem.</blockquote>
<p>The user is supposed to run it manually or via a periodic system service. The
recommended period is a month but could be less. The estimated device bandwidth
utilization is about 80% on an idle filesystem. The IO priority class is by
default <em>idle</em> so background scrub should not interfere with normal filesystem
operation significantly.</p>
<p>The scrubbing status is recorded in <em>/var/lib/btrfs/</em> in textual files named
<em>scrub.status.UUID</em> for a filesystem identified by the given UUID. (Progress
state is communicated through a named pipe in file <em>scrub.progress.UUID</em> in the
same directory.) The status file is updated every 5 seconds. A resumed scrub
will continue from the last saved position.</p>
==SUBCOMMAND==

<dl>
<dt>
<b>cancel</b> <em>&lt;path&gt;</em>|<em>&lt;device&gt;</em>
<dd>
<p>
If a scrub is running on the filesystem identified by <em>path</em> cancel it.
</p>
<p>If a <em>device</em> is specified, the corresponding filesystem is found and
<b>btrfs scrub cancel</b> behaves as if it was called on that filesystem.</p>

<dt>
<b>resume</b> [-BdqrR] [-c <em>&lt;ioprio_class&gt;</em> -n <em>&lt;ioprio_classdata&gt;</em>] <em>&lt;path&gt;</em>|<em>&lt;device&gt;</em>
<dd>
<p>
Resume a cancelled or interrupted scrub on the filesystem identified by
<em>path</em> or on a given <em>device</em>.
</p>
<p>Does not start a new scrub if the last scrub finished successfully.</p>
<p><tt>Options</tt></p>
<p>see <b>scrub start</b>.</p>

<dt>
<b>start</b> [-BdqrRf] [-c <em>&lt;ioprio_class&gt;</em> -n <em>&lt;ioprio_classdata&gt;</em>] <em>&lt;path&gt;</em>|<em>&lt;device&gt;</em>
<dd>
<p>
Start a scrub on all devices of the filesystem identified by <em>path</em> or on
a single <em>device</em>. If a scrub is already running, the new one fails.
</p>
<p>Without options, scrub is started as a background process.</p>
<p>The default IO priority of scrub is the idle class. The priority can be
configured similar to the [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ionice.1.html ionice(1)] syntax using <em>-c</em> and <em>-n</em> options.</p>
<p><tt>Options</tt></p>
<dl>
<dt>
-B
<dd>
<p>
do not background and print scrub statistics when finished
</p>

<dt>
-d
<dd>
<p>
print separate statistics for each device of the filesystem (<em>-B</em> only) at the end
</p>

<dt>
-q
<dd>
<p>
be quiet, omit error messages and statistics
</p>

<dt>
-r
<dd>
<p>
run in read-only mode, do not attempt to correct anything, can be run on a read-only
filesystem
</p>

<dt>
-R
<dd>
<p>
print raw statistics per-device instead of a summary
</p>

<dt>
-c <em>&lt;ioprio_class&gt;</em>
<dd>
<p>
set IO priority class (see [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ionice.1.html ionice(1)] manpage)
</p>

<dt>
-n <em>&lt;ioprio_classdata&gt;</em>
<dd>
<p>
set IO priority classdata (see [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ionice.1.html ionice(1)] manpage)
</p>

<dt>
-f
<dd>
<p>
force starting new scrub even if a scrub is already running,
this can useful when scrub status file is damaged and reports a running
scrub although it is not, but should not normally be necessary
</p>

</dl>

<dt>
<b>status</b> [-d] <em>&lt;path&gt;</em>|<em>&lt;device&gt;</em>
<dd>
<p>
Show status of a running scrub for the filesystem identified by <em>path</em> or
for the specified <em>device</em>.
</p>
<p>If no scrub is running, show statistics of the last finished or cancelled scrub
for that filesystem or device.</p>
<p><tt>Options</tt></p>
<dl>
<dt>
-d
<dd>
<p>
print separate statistics for each device of the filesystem
</p>

</dl>

</dl>
==EXIT STATUS==

<p><b>btrfs scrub</b> returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non zero is
returned in case of failure:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
1
<dd>
<p>
scrub couldn&#8217;t be performed
</p>

<dt>
2
<dd>
<p>
there is nothing to resume
</p>

<dt>
3
<dd>
<p>
scrub found uncorrectable errors
</p>

</dl>
