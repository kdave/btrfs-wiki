==NAME==

btrfs-zero-log - clear out log tree

==SYNOPSIS==

'''btrfs-zero-log''' &lt;dev&gt;

==DESCRIPTION==

'''btrfs-zero-log''' will remove the log tree if log tree is corrupt, which will allow you to mount the filesystem again.

The common case where this happens has been fixed a long time ago, so it is unlikely that you will see this particular problem.

One can determine whether '''btrfs-zero-log''' is needed according to the kernel backtrace:

{| width="100%" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#e8e8e8"
|
 <code>? replay_one_dir_item+0xb5/0xb5 [btrfs]
 ? walk_log_tree+0x9c/0x19d [btrfs]
 ? btrfs_read_fs_root_no_radix+0x169/0x1a1 [btrfs]
 ? btrfs_recover_log_trees+0x195/0x29c [btrfs]
 ? replay_one_dir_item+0xb5/0xb5 [btrfs]
 ? btree_read_extent_buffer_pages+0x76/0xbc [btrfs]
 ? open_ctree+0xff6/0x132c [btrfs]</code>
|}

If the errors are like above, then '''btrfs-zero-log''' should be used to clear the log and the filesystem may be mounted normally again.

'''Note:''' If you use btrfs as the root filesystem, you may want to include '''btrfs-zero-log''' into initramdisk if the log problems hits you often.

==EXIT STATUS==

'''btrfs-zero-log''' will return 0 if no error happened. Other exit code means some problems happened.
