Rudimentary conversion from asciidoc to mediawiki.

Requires:

* asciidoc

Optional:

Conversion:

* preprocess asciidoc
  - adjust NOTE and WARNING, we want own formatting, eg. in the option lists
* asciidoc to lightweight html that will be the final mw
* postprocess mediawiki
  - add hyperlinks to external manpages
  - other visual artifacts that the conversion tools did not get right
  - clean whitespace

Conversion tools:

- tuned asciidoc config is the best option

Previous attempts:

- perl modules were most successful
- pandoc can do direct conversion but did not understand nested lists
- still not perfect, too much postprocessing

How to use it:

- copy or link .asciidoc files from git/Documentation
- make
- upload .mw files to the respective wiki pages
