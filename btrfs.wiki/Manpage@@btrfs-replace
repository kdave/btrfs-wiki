==NAME==

btrfs-replace - replace devices managed by btrfs with other device.

==SYNOPSIS==

'''btrfs replace''' &lt;subcommand&gt; &lt;args&gt;

==DESCRIPTION==

'''btrfs replace''' is used to replace btrfs managed devices with other device.

Note: this is not currently supported for RAID5/6 profiles and must use the device add/delete workaround.

It is recommended to see [[Manpage/btrfs-device|btrfs-device(8)]] for more details about btrfs device management.

==SUBCOMMAND==

; '''start''' [-Bfr] &lt;srcdev&gt;|&lt;devid&gt; &lt;targetdev&gt; &lt;path&gt;
: Replace device of a btrfs filesystem. <br /> On a live filesystem, duplicate the data to the target device which is currently stored on the source device. If the source device is not available anymore, or if the -r option is set, the data is built only using the RAID redundancy mechanisms. After completion of the operation, the source device is removed from the filesystem. If the &lt;srcdev&gt; is a numerical value, it is assumed to be the device id of the filesystem which is mounted at &lt;path&gt;, otherwise is is the path to the source device. If the source device is disconnected, from the system, you have to use the devid parameter format. The &lt;targetdev&gt; needs to be same size or larger than the &lt;srcdev&gt;. <br /><code>Options</code><br />
:; -r
:: only read from &lt;srcdev&gt; if no other zero-defect mirror exists. (enable this if your drive has lots of read errors, the access would be very slow)
:; -f
:: force using and overwriting &lt;targetdev&gt; even if it looks like containing a valid btrfs filesystem. <br /> A valid filesystem is assumed if a btrfs superblock is found which contains a correct checksum. Devices which are currently mounted are never allowed to be used as the &lt;targetdev&gt;.
:; -B
:: no background replace.
; '''status''' [-1] &lt;mount_point&gt;
: Print status and progress information of a running device replace operation. <br /><code>Options</code><br />
:; -1
:: print once instead of print continuously until the replace operation finishes (or is canceled)
; '''cancel''' &lt;mount_point&gt;
: Cancel a running device replace operation.

==EXIT STATUS==

'''btrfs replace''' returns a zero exist status if it succeeds. Non zero is returned in case of failure.

==AVAILABILITY==

'''btrfs''' is part of btrfs-progs. Please refer to the btrfs wiki http://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org for further details.
