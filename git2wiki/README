Rudimentary conversion from asciidoc to mediawiki.

Requires:

* perl HTML::WikiConverter
* perl HTML::WikiConverter::MediaWiki

Optional:

* perl XHTML::MediaWiki

Conversion:

* preprocess asciidoc
  - [obsoleted] glue lines with + directly, the convertors were confused
  - due to an unknown bug in html -> mediawiki conversion, a newline after
    a standalone '+' is lost, we have to look for such lines and insert
    a temporary marker than gets replaced by <br /> in the html, before mw
    conversion
  - adjust NOTE and WARNING, we want own formatting, eg. in the option lists
* asciidoc to html
* html to mediawiki
* postprocess mediawiki
  - add hyperlinks to external manpages
  - other visual artifacts that the conversion tools did not get right
  - clean whitespace

Conversion tools:

- perl modules were most successful
- pandoc can do direct conversion but did not understand nested lists
- still not perfect, too much postprocessing

How to use it:

- copy or link .asciidoc files from git/Documentation
- make
- upload .mw files to the respective wiki pages
