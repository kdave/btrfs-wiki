'''Btrfs''' is a modern copy on write (COW) filesystem for Linux aimed at implementing advanced features while also focusing on fault tolerance, repair and easy administration. Its main features and benefits are:

* '''Snapshots''' which do not make the full copy of files
* '''RAID''' - support for software-based RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 10, ...
* '''Self-healing''' - checksums for data and metadata, automatic detection of silent data corruptions

Development of Btrfs started in 2007. Since that time it's been part of the Linux kernel and is under active development.

Jointly developed by multiple companies (https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contributors.html, Btrfs is licensed under the GPL and open for contribution from anyone.

== Development and Issue Reporting ==

'''For feature status, please refer to the [[Status]] page.'''

The Btrfs code base is stable. However, new features are still under development. Every effort is made to ensure that it remains stable and fast at each and every commit. This rapid pace of development means that the filesystem improves ''noticeably'' with every new Linux release so it's ''highly'' recommended that users run the most modern kernel possible.

For benchmarks, it's recommended to test the latest stable Linux version, and not any older, as well as the latest Linux development versions. Also, it's recommended to test the various [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Administration.html#mount-options mount options] such as different [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Compression.html compression] options.

If you find any behavior you suspect to be caused by a bug, performance issues, or have any questions about using Btrfs, please email the [[Btrfs mailing list]] (no subscription required). Please report bugs on [[Problem_FAQ#How_do_I_report_bugs_and_issues.3F|Bugzilla]].

== Features ==

Linux has a wealth of filesystems from which to choose, but we are facing a number of challenges with scaling to the large storage subsystems that are becoming common in today's data centers. Filesystems need to scale in their ability to address and manage large storage, and also in their ability to detect, repair and tolerate errors in the data stored on disk.

=== Major Features Currently Implemented ===
* Extent based file storage
* 2^64 byte == 16 EiB maximum file size (practical limit is 8 EiB due to Linux VFS)
* [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Inline-files.html Space-efficient packing of small files]
* Space-efficient indexed directories
* Dynamic inode allocation
* Writable snapshots, read-only snapshots
* [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Subvolumes.html Subvolumes] (separate internal filesystem roots)
* [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Checksumming.html Checksums on data and metadata] (crc32c, xxhash, sha256, blake2b)
* [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Compression.html Compression] (ZLIB, LZO, ZSTD), heuristics
* Integrated [[Multiple_Device_Support|multiple device support]]
** File Striping
** File Mirroring
** File Striping+Mirroring
** Single and Dual Parity implementations (experimental, not production-ready)
* SSD (flash storage) awareness
** [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Trim.html TRIM/Discard] for reporting free blocks for reuse
** Optimizations (e.g. avoiding unnecessary seek optimizations, sending writes in clusters, even if they are from unrelated files. This results in larger write operations and faster write throughput)
* Background [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Scrub.html scrub] process for finding and repairing errors of files with redundant copies
* Online filesystem [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Defragmentation.html defragmentation]
* [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/btrfs-check.html Offline filesystem check]
* In-place [[Conversion_from_Ext3|conversion]] of existing ext2/3/4 and reiserfs file systems
* [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Seeding-device.html Seeding devices]. Create a (readonly) filesystem that acts as a template to seed other Btrfs filesystems. The original filesystem and devices are included as a readonly starting point for the new filesystem. Using copy on write, all modifications are stored on different devices; the original is unchanged.
* Subvolume-aware [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Qgroups.html quota support]
* [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Send-receive.html Send/receive] of subvolume changes, efficient incremental filesystem mirroring and [[Incremental_Backup|backup]]
* Batch, or out-of-band [[deduplication]] (happens after writes, not during)
* [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Swapfile.html Swapfile] support
* [https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tree-checker.html Tree-checker], post-read and pre-write metadata verification
* [[Zoned]] mode support (SMR/ZBC/ZNS friendly allocation)
* fsverity integration

The wiki is still in use, however the main portion of documenation is being migrated to https://btrfs.readthedocs.io.

Wiki edits and fixups are welcome and may be copied to the RTD documentation eventually. Please create an account and wait for approval (this is a necessary spam protection and we cannot remove it).
